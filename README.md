# Border-plugin
A plugin for Minecraft 1.18 which makes it so the border grows when someone is online. Everything can be customised by an operator.

I made this plugin as a test to learn more about programming with Java for for example Minecraft. This is something I might update as I see and if there are bugs you can submit them but this is really just a test for myself that I found interesting.
